# Vigilance
Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

Overview:

Vigilance is a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS) developed in Python, designed to enhance network security through advanced threat detection and prevention mechanisms. This system incorporates several sophisticated features such as whitelist/blacklist management, threat intelligence integration, and security analytics feeds, making it a comprehensive solution for modern cybersecurity challenges.

Features:

Whitelist/Blacklist Management:

•	Whitelist Management: Allows administrators to specify trusted IP addresses, domains, or URLs that are permitted to access the network without restriction. This reduces false positives and ensures that legitimate traffic is not incorrectly flagged as malicious.
•	Blacklist Management: Enables the blocking of known malicious IP addresses, domains, or URLs, preventing them from accessing the network. This helps in proactively defending against known threats.

Threat Intelligence Integration:

•	Threat Intelligence Feeds: The IDS integrates with various threat intelligence sources to obtain up-to-date information about potential threats. This includes malicious IP addresses, domains, URLs, and other indicators of compromise (IOCs).
•	Automated Updates: The system automatically updates its threat databases, ensuring that the latest threat information is always available for detection and response.

API Integration:

•	Seamless API Integration: The IDS uses APIs to integrate with external threat intelligence platforms and security analytics feeds. This enables real-time data exchange and enhances the system's ability to detect and respond to emerging threats.
•	Customizable API Endpoints: Administrators can configure custom API endpoints to integrate with their preferred threat intelligence sources, providing flexibility and adaptability to the evolving threat landscape.

Security Analytics Feeds:

Enhanced Threat Detection: By merging with security analytics feeds, the IDS gathers comprehensive information about malicious activities and patterns. This integration results in a 10% increase in threat detection capabilities, providing a more proactive defense mechanism.
Real-Time Analysis: The system performs real-time analysis of network traffic against the data from security analytics feeds, enabling timely identification and mitigation of potential threats.
